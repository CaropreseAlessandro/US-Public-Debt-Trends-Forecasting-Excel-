# 📈 US Public Debt Trends & Forecasting (Excel Project)

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the historical trajectory of the United States National Debt. Working as a Data Analyst for a debt agency in Washington DC, I investigated historical growth rates and seasonal patterns to provide a data-driven projection of future debt levels for the US Government.

## 🧠 Technical Skills & Formulas Applied
I utilized advanced financial analysis techniques in Excel to process historical fiscal data:
* **Time Series Analysis**: Calculated the **Yearly Debt Percentage Increase** to measure the velocity of debt accumulation over the decades.
* **Seasonal Aggregation**: Utilized Pivot Tables and the `AVERAGE` function to group debt fluctuations by month, identifying cyclical fiscal peaks.
* **Predictive Forecasting**: Developed a 5-year growth model using historical trends to estimate debt levels through 2027.
* **Data Definition Management**: Differentiated between "Debt Held by the Public" and "Intragovernmental Holdings" to provide a complete view of the Total Public Debt Outstanding.

## 📊 Data Visualization & Dashboards
To make complex economic data accessible, I developed several visualizations:
* **Line Charts**: Used to track the steady and accelerating climb of the US Debt from the 1990s to 2023.
* **Comparative Bar Charts**: Created to show the average debt increase per month, making it easy to identify the "highest" and "lowest" fiscal periods.
* **Forecasting Dashboard**: A dedicated view showing the projected path of debt held by the public, highlighting the $33 Trillion milestone.

## 💡 Key Business Questions Addressed
1. **What was the Yearly Debt Percentage Increase?** I calculated the YoY growth to show how the debt burden has evolved relative to previous years.
2. **Which months historically see the highest/lowest increases?** * **Highest:** January, December, and November (likely due to year-end fiscal cycles and holiday spending).
   * **Lowest:** April, May, and June.
3. **What is the projected growth for the next few years?** Based on the analysis, debt held by the public is projected to increase at a steady rate, reaching approximately **$33 Trillion by 2027**.

⚠️ Note on File Optimization
   To comply with GitHub’s file size limits and ensure better performance, the raw dataset has been reduced through strategic sampling
